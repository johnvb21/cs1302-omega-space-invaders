My app is a version of Space Invaders, which is an arcade game. Users have the ability to
move their spaceship, and fire at the enemy ships. Once all the ships for the level are defeated, the next level is loaded with
an additional row of enemies.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I was able to learn how objects and classes work together more intimately.
This was due to the fact that we were tasked with building the app from scratch.
I also learned how to use the javafx animation timer, which was essential for updating my graphics.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would try to be a bit more organized, and do more planning on paper before actually writing code.
I would also try to remember to commit changes more often.
